# Context
**Updated:** 2026-02-27

## Current Layer
Skills repo — bootstrapped and live. Status: verified

## Last Completed
All 10 skills extracted, committed, and pushed to `krishamaze/skills` on `main`. `project-memory` installed to 8 agents via symlink.

## Active Blocker
None

## Next Action
Add skills to new projects (e.g. `threads-agent`) as they mature. Write new skills as new stack patterns solidify.

## Deferred
- Cleaning up `.skill` zip files and `files.zip` from the repo root (not committed, just local clutter)
